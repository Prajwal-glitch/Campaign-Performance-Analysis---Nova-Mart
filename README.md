# AtliQ Mart Promotions Data Analysis

This project is part of the **Codebasics Virtual Internship** where I analyzed the impact of various promotions on sales performance across different cities, stores, and product categories for **AtliQ Mart**.  

The analysis was done using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** and insights were derived through visualizations and metrics like Incremental Sales Units (ISU%) and Incremental Revenue (IR%).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Performed

1. **Store Distribution Analysis**  
   - Visualized number of stores across cities.  
   - Compared Bengaluru (highest store count) with Chennai & Hyderabad.  

2. **Category Sales Analysis** (Sankranti Campaign)  
   - Calculated category-wise percentage contribution to post-promo sales.  
   - Visualized using a pie chart.  

3. **Price vs Sales Correlation**  
   - Examined correlation between base price (after promo) and units sold (after promo).  
   - Found price sensitivity trends.  

4. **Pre-Promo Sales Distribution**  
   - Analyzed sales distribution before promo across categories.  
   - Insights for category-specific promotion planning.  

5. **ISU% Across Cities**  
   - Identified cities with highest and lowest incremental units sold after promo.  
   - Compared effectiveness of promotions by geography.  

6. **Promotion Type Analysis (Hyderabad)**  
   - Compared Incremental Revenue vs Incremental Units Sold.  
   - Identified promo types that maximize revenue vs volume.  

7. **Revenue Comparison (Bengaluru)**  
   - Compared revenue before and after promotions for each category.  
   - Observed promotional effectiveness in driving revenue growth.

## üìà Key Insights

- **Bengaluru** has the largest store network, giving it a natural sales advantage.  
- **Madurai** showed the highest ISU% (121%), highlighting strong promo effectiveness.  
- **Visakhapatnam** showed almost no uplift, suggesting promo redesign is needed.  
- **Product categories** like Grocery & Staples benefited most from promotions.  
- Promotions increase **volume significantly**, but the impact on **revenue depends on discount depth**.
